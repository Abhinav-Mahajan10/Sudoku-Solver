# Sudoku-Solver
Take an image of an unsolved sudoku on your phone, send it to my python flask server, process the image, or just upload the path name of the picture in your laptop, use a CNN model to predict the numbers and blank spaces, then show it on the laptop screen to the user to correct incorrect incorrect entries(if any) and solve the sudoku and return it.
